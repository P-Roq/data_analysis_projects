    "Jeopardy is a popular TV show in the US where participants answer questions to win money [source: Dataquest]. In this project we explore a sample of 20000 (out of 216930) questions and respective answers, originally compiled by a [reddit user](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file/), and try to figure out ways of maximizing the earnings by looking for patterns in the data. Two of the questions we'll try to explore are:\n",

    "The value above suggests that, on average, aprox. 72% of the words used in a question were already used in a previous similar question. Although neatly conveyed in a single measurement, the validity of the previous method as a mean capable of identifying repeated questions can be skeptically questioned. First, resorting to a bank of repeated words to determine which words in a given question are also repeated may not be very useful, since the same words may be used to formulate different questions. Also, computing the ratio of repeated words of a question in relation to the total number of words does not make great sense; by definition, categorizing a question as repeated entails that a previous question, which had the same context, was also answered similarly (in this case we seek identical answers). We are looking for a binary situation such as: 'is this question a repeated one or not?'; we should not seek to answer: 'this question is 75% repeated' because three out of four words were used randomly (i.e. in various possible contexts) in past questions.

The problem stems from the fact that, when sampling for complex words (terms), we are not taking into account that questions with such terms have extremely low observed counts.

According to [3], the total number of samples is recommended to be greater than 13, otherwise exact tests (such as Barnard’s Exact test) should be used because they do not overreject.\n",

    "Observing `chi_squared_df_2` we can assume that there is some evidence that the distributions of these terms differ from a distribution based on random draws where the probability of drawing a high value or a low value question is equally distributed with a 50% chance (we can reject the null hypothesis in all cases, since all p-values are under the 5% threshold), so that we can at least try to pick some subjects to study, based on these terms, because we know that by default, they are likely to be included more often in high value questions than in low value questions. Looking at the list of terms, which is very short, we see that some of them seem to be generic, without a specific context; others, are indicative of certain subjects, e.g. 'pulitzer' (Journalism/Literature/Politics), 'painter' (Art/History/Historical Figures), plants (botany/biology).\n",

    "To conclude we can re-state the three major conclusion withdrawn from this analysis: i) words within a random question are unlikely to match the respective answer: on average, words in the answer constitute 7% of the total number of words in the respective question; ii) there is some evidence that questions with complex words (5 or more characters) have repetitions or similar questions, since on average, 72% of the words in one of those questions have been used previously; iii) to pursuit a game strategy of answering high value questions based on their themes, one can try to withdraw inspiration from the list of terms in `chi_squared_df_2`, since these terms are more likely to be associated with high value questions than low value.    \n",
