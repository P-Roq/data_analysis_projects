At the time of this writing, [Data Science Stack Exchange (DSSE)](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/) is on the bottom 10 sites with respect to this metric.\n",

    "1.1. As the [DSSE's tour page describes](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/tour), the type of questions that are welcome on the platform are 'pratical, detailed questions', related to data science. The same logic can be applied to any of the Stack Exchange websites, where this type of engagement is done under a wide but identifible subject such as the aforementioned case of data science, or others, like operating sistems (e.g. [Ask Ubuntu](https://askubuntu.com/https://askubuntu.com/)), languages (e.g. [English Language & Usage](https://english.stackexchange.com/)), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.2. DSSE's home site is very directed to it's main purpose; the central and main section is composed by the essential tools that should allow the user to find questions useful to his/her purposes. At the top is the search bar, followed below by the 'Ask Question' link, main tags and useful filters tabs ('Active', 'Bountied', 'Hot', etc.). On the left is the organizational panel for the DSSE's site, which redirects to job search, and [private groups paid services](https://stackoverflow.com/teams). The right section is the list of the 'hottest' questions taken from all the Stack Exchange branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "From our frame of work, which is to look for 'what people want to lear about data science', what seems to be important is the clues provided by the meta-data gathered in form of tags. These key words allow to identify what are the most common concepts that arise from the pool of questions wich have many subject matters. Similarly, the 'hot' tab for example, is useful to know which subjects and concepts are being currently discussed in high volume. This offers the possibility to track in time the flow of interest shown in a given key concept or subject.\n",

    "1.3. Each post has the following main information:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "     - Question title.\n",
    "     - Question content.\n",

    "     - User info: name, score, reputation, badges.\n",

    "     - question rating (by other users).\n",
    "     \n",
