    ">\n",
    ">Thinking back to your experience when you first started learning programming, it occurs to you that if you wanted to figure out what programming content to write, you could consult Stack Overflow (a question and answer website about programming) and see what kind of content is more popular.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">If you open the link in the image shared above, you'll find a complete list of Stack Exchange websites sorted by percentage of questions that received answers. At the time of this writing, [Data Science Stack Exchange (DSSE)](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/) is on the bottom 10 sites with respect to this metric.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The fact that DSSE is a data science dedicated site (contrarily to the others), coupled with it having a lot of unanswered questions, makes it an ideal candidate for this investigation. DSSE will be the focus of this guided project.\"\n",

    "**What kind of questions are welcome on this site?**\n",
    "\n",
    "As the [DSSE's tour page describes](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/tour), the type of questions that are welcome on the platform are 'practical, detailed questions' related to data science. The same logic can be applied to any of the Stack Exchange websites, where this type of engagement is done under a broad but identifiable subject. Other examples of sites within the group are: [Ask Ubuntu](https://askubuntu.com/https://askubuntu.com/) (a platform dedicated to Ubuntu, an operating system within the Linux family),  [English Language & Usage](https://english.stackexchange.com/), and [Mathematics](https://math.stackexchange.com/).\n",

    "  - **Does any of them look useful towards our goal?**\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "DSSE's home site subdivides into 4 sections:\n",
    "- Questions - a page dedicated to browse and ask questions.\n",
    "- Tags - tags are keywords associated to the topic(s) of each question. The Tags section groups all the questions by their tag(s), for ease of browsing. \n",
    "- Users - this section allows the public to browse for DSSE's users.\n",
    "- Unanswered - lists questions that haven't been accepted by moderators or do not have any upvote from other users.\n",
    "\n",
    "From our frame of work, which is to look for 'what people want to learn about data science', what seems to be important is the clues provided by the meta-data gathered in form of tags. These keywords allow to identify which are the most popular concepts that arise from the pool of questions which have many subject matters. Similarly, the 'hot' tab in the Home page can be equally useful, offering the possibility to track the current flow of interest shown in a given key concept or subject given the questions that are generating more engagement at the moment.\n",

As we can see, the main difference between the two tags is the order of magnitude; in terms of behaviour both tags experiment an increase in popularity from 2014 mid 2018 aproximately; plateauing until 2020, and after that, visibily decreasing. \n",

    "One thing to say about the use of tags as a proxy of what content is popular, is that they are ineherently correlated with the DSSE's popularity as a platform. As we can observe, this site underperforms in terms of popularity, when comparing with the other Stack Exchange branches, which may be cannibalizing users and content from DSSE. Sure enough, when adding to the graph all the posts in a given quarter, we observe that there are a few valleys from 2019 to 2021, which may indicate a loss of interest in the platform. The fact that in both 'deep-learning' and 'machine-learning' those valleys are smoother than in the 'all_questions', indicates that the interest of these topics is robust even when the overall number of posts decreases, therefore, one can believe that this kind of content is a viable bet for a new platform that wants to promote data cscience content."

Because there are some of those redundant associations, the solution project suggests that we make use of domain knowledge in order to define some association rules, which in practice means that the researcher should go over each popular tag, and see if it is related in a relevant manner to the concept of machine learning, something that was already somewhat sketched in the 'Brainstorm notes' in [Task 7](#Task_7).\n",

    "**Comment:** as we can see in the time series figure above, the x axis spans over the entire time period of the `CreationDate` column in the main dataframe `all_questions`, but in quarterly data, where each tick represents one quarter of a give year. **The similarity in the behaviour of both tags, shows that it is likely that they are correlated, and that it could be wiser to know if it is possible to treat them as just one aggregated concept**. As we can see, the main difference between the two tags is the order of magnitude; in terms of behaviour both tags experiment an increase in popularity from 2014 mid 2018 aproximately; plateauing until 2020, and after that, visibily decreasing. \n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to say about the use of tags as a proxy of what content is popular, is that they are ineherently correlated with the DSSE's popularity as a platform. As we can observe, this site underperforms in terms of popularity, when comparing with the other Stack Exchange branches, which may be cannibalizing users and content from DSSE. Sure enough, when adding to the graph all the posts in a given quarter, we observe that there are a few valleys from 2019 to 2021, which may indicate a loss of interest in the platform. The fact that in both 'deep-learning' and 'machine-learning' lines the valleys are smoother than in the 'all_questions', indicates that the interest of these topics is robust even when the overall number of posts decreases, therefore, one can believe that this kind of content is a viable bet for a new platform that wants to promote data science content.\n",
