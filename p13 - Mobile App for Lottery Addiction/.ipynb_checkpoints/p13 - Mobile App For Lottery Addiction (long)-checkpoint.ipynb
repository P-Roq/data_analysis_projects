    "In this project we were able to build a series of algorithms that can be implemented into an app, which allow the user to retrieve answers to the most frequently asked questions one could have regarding the chance of winning the lottery. These algorithms not only check whether the values placed were correctly specified but try to identify possible mistakes. Along th same line, the information retrieved by the algorithms is conveyed in a clear manner, allowing the user to relate the input/bet to its associated probability.\n"

    "That was all for the guided part of the project! We managed to write four main functions for our app:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `one_ticket_probability()` — calculates the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `check_historical_occurrence()` — checks whether a certain combination has occurred in the Canada lottery data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `multi_ticket_probability()` — calculates the probability for any number of of tickets between 1 and 13,983,816.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `probability_less_6()` — calculates the probability of having two, three, four or five winning numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible features for a second version of the app include:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Making the outputs even easier to understand by adding fun analogies (for example, we can find probabilities for strange events and compare with the chances of winning in lottery; for instance, we can output something along the lines \"You are 100 times more likely to be the victim of a shark attack than winning the lottery\").\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Combining the `one_ticket_probability()` and `check_historical_occurrence()` to output information on probability and historical occurrence at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Creating a function similar to `probability_less_6()` which calculates the probability of having at least two, three, four or five winning numbers. Hint: the number of successful outcomes for having at least four winning numbers is the sum of these three numbers:\n",
    "    - The number of successful outcomes for having four winning numbers exactly.\n",
    "    - The number of successful outcomes for having five winning numbers exactly.\n",
    "    - The number of successful outcomes for having six winning numbers exactly.\n",
