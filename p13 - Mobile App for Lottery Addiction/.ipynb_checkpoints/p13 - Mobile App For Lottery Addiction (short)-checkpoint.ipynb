    "\n",
    "The first task consists in writing an algorithm that calculates the probability of winning the big prize, i.e. being able to guess all the 6 numbers drawn out of the 49 available. \n",
    "\n",
    "`one_ticket_probability()` works by first redirecting the bet (output) to an auxiliary function `check_input()`; this function will check whether the bet meets the five conditions established below:  \n",
    "\n",
    "Conditions for the bet to be considered correctly placed:\n",
    "1. the bet should be placed as a list object (inside squared brackets).\n",
    "2. the list must have six values.\n",
    "3. the values are integers (natural numbers).\n",
    "4. those numbers must not repeat.\n",
    "5. every number must be inside the 1 to 49 range.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case that all conditions are met, the output of `check_input()` will be piped as input to `one_ticket_probability_cal()`, which will calculate and return the probability of winning the lottery. In the case that one or more conditions is broken, `check_input` returns a message detailing which conditions have been broken, asking the user to insert a corrected version of the bet.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We also write another two helper functions that will be useful for calculating probabilities:\n",
    "- `factorial(n)` calculates the [factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) of an integer 'n': \n",
    "    - $n! = \\prod_{i=1} ^{n} i$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "In this project we were able to build a series of algorithms that can be implemented into an app, which allow the user to retrieve answers to the most frequently asked questions one could have regarding the chance of winning the lottery. These algorithms not only check whether the values placed were correctly specified but try to identify possible mistakes. Along th same line, the information retrieved by the algorithms is conveyed in a clear manner, allowing the user to relate the input/bet to its associated probability.\n",
